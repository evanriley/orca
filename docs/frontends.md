# Native frontend boundary

First-party graphical applications are thin clients of `liborca`. They own
windows, widgets, accessibility presentation, and native event loops; library,
transport, metadata, and mutation semantics remain in the core.

## C ABI

`liborca/orca.h` exposes opaque runtime ownership, typed generational handles,
POD snapshots, and bounded callback-scoped query views. Both static and shared
libraries install with the header. Returned string views are valid only during
their callback, so no SQLite row or Zig container crosses the ABI. Every page is
bounded to 512 rows.

**Threading is a contract, not a convention.** All `orca_*` calls for one
runtime come from a single thread, `orca_runtime_poll_event` included, which is
single-consumer. Debug builds record the creating thread and return
`ORCA_STATUS_WRONG_THREAD` on a violation. The runtime behind the boundary is
genuinely multithreaded — a decode engine per Player, a registered worker per
scan — and its object pools take no lock, so a GUI timer racing
`orca_runtime_destroy` is a real use-after-free.

The boundary covers the whole engine, not a fragment of it:

- **Library and roots.** Open/close, bounded track and health pages, root
  add/remove/query.
- **Jobs.** `orca_library_start_scan` registers a background worker and returns
  immediately; `orca_job_snapshot_get`, `orca_job_cancel` and
  `orca_library_scan_stats` observe it. Scan progress is a count of files
  processed with `has_total = 0` — a walk has no honest denominator until it has
  finished. A scan projects as it commits;
  `orca_library_start_projection` reprojects without a walk.
- **Events.** `orca_runtime_pump` drives the control lane and
  `orca_runtime_poll_event` drains the lossless completion channel and the
  coalescing telemetry channel into a tagged POD with a named `extern union`
  payload. Events are hints and correlations; authoritative consumers read
  snapshots.
- **Transport and queue.** Play by Track id, enqueue, next/previous, clear,
  repeat, shuffle, volume, `seek_ms`, paged queue listing, and
  `orca_player_status`, which carries transport, epoch, position, duration,
  track, queue position and volume in one lock-free read. Position comes from
  the packed epoch+frames atomic the render callback writes; now-playing reports
  the audible entry, never the decode cursor.
- **Devices and Zones.** Enumeration, Zone create/attach/open/close/status, and
  `orca_player_open_default_output`, which creates, attaches and opens in one
  call so a single-output frontend never has to know Zones exist.

`orca_player_play` is refused unless the Player has a loaded source or a
non-empty queue *and* an attached Zone: a transport that reports PLAYING while
nothing renders is a defect, not a state.

## Linux GTK4

`orca-gtk` is a Zig client of liborca's public Zig API, built on GTK 4 and
libadwaita, both bound by hand in `apps/linux/gtk.zig` and `apps/linux/adw.zig`.
Every liborca call happens on the GTK main thread, from a signal handler or the
100 ms tick.

```sh
zig build run-linux                                   # library in $XDG_DATA_HOME/orca
ORCA_LIBRARY=/path/to/library.db zig build run-linux  # another library
```

The window is an `AdwNavigationSplitView`:

- The sidebar (`AdwSidebar`) lists the pages, shows the queue length, and
  shows scan progress at its foot while a scan runs.
- **Tracks** is the Artist and Album browse panes beside the track list. The
  list pages 512 rows at a time from liborca as it scrolls, and a header
  click re-queries in the engine's order rather than sorting loaded rows. The
  playing track is marked. A library with no tracks shows a welcome page with
  Add Music Folder; a scan in progress shows there too.
- **Queue** is the Player's queue as the engine resolves it, with the audible
  entry marked.
- The player bar spans the window: cover, title and artist; shuffle, previous,
  play, next and repeat; the seek bar; volume, the output menu and the queue.

Below 760sp the sidebar collapses behind a back button, the browse panes hide
and the player bar tightens. Messages are toasts. Shortcuts are listed in the
shortcuts dialog (Ctrl+?); Space and Ctrl+←/→ are handled by a bubble-phase key
controller rather than application accelerators, so a focused search box keeps
them.

The output is opened on first play, not at launch. `ORCA_OUTPUT_DEVICE` pins it
to an orca device id, overriding the output menu; see
[Testing playback without making noise](../CLAUDE.md).

The player bar's cover is loaded when the audible Track changes, never on the
tick, and decoded through `gdk_pixbuf_new_from_stream_at_scale` at 160 pixels,
so an 11 MiB JPEG never materializes at full resolution. A track with no
readable cover shows a placeholder. Album art in lists waits for an artwork
worker in liborca: loading covers on the main thread for a scrolling grid
would stall it.

The frontend owns `org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.orca` on the session bus when one is
available. MPRIS methods invoke the same Player handle, and `PlaybackStatus` is
read from and signaled from authoritative snapshots.

`nix build` installs `share/applications/org.orca_music.Orca.desktop` and the
icon, so the package can be installed like any desktop application.

## macOS SwiftUI

`apps/macos` is a Swift Package client of the installed C module. It keeps the
same bounded 256-row paging contract in a native SwiftUI `List`, exposes AppKit
menus and shortcuts, and mirrors authoritative Player snapshots through
`MPNowPlayingInfoCenter` and `MPRemoteCommandCenter`. It links against
`zig-out/lib/liborca` and does not import Zig, SQLite, codec, or audio layouts.
SwiftUI file import, URL drop handling, notifications, accessibility labels,
menus, and keyboard shortcuts remain presentation-only platform concerns.
